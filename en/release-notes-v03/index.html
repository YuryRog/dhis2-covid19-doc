    <h1 id="covid-19-package-release-notes-v03">COVID-19 Package Release Notes v0.3</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>We have made several updates to the existing package to align with new COVID-19 <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/surveillance-and-case-definitions">surveillance guidelines released by the WHO on March 20, 2020</a> and introduced new components to the overall package of support. Please review the notes here and contact us on the COVID-19 discussion board in the <a href="https://community.dhis2.org/c/implementation/covid-19/">community of practice</a> with any questions.</p>
<p><strong>All metadata packages and documentation can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.dhis2.org/covid-19">dhis2.org.covid-19</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Packages are currently translated into French, Spanish, Portuguese and Russian, with additional languages in the pipeline (Arabic, Lao, Burmese). We can support metadata package translations in our global translation platform and invite the community to contribute if your country is interested in translating the package for a new language. <a href="https://community.dhis2.org/t/the-new-dhis2-translation-platform-is-now-available/37755">Check out our Community of Practice announcement </a>and get started as a contributing translator here <a href="https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/implementer/html/user-interface-localization.html#translation-server">by joining the DHIS2 translation platform</a>.

</ol>
<h3 id="new-points-of-entry-tracker-program"><strong>NEW</strong> Points of Entry Tracker Program</h3>
<p>The Points of Entry tracker program use case was designed to support the registration of travellers entering a country with a history of travel to, or residence in, a country/area/territory reporting local transmission of COVID-19 who may need to be followed up to ensure no symptoms develop. It is based on the design implemented by HISP Sri Lanka to support the Sri Lanka Ministry of Health with minor changes to make the program more generic to global use and to align with the other tracker programs in the COVID-19 package. The package supports interventions at Points of Entry detailed in the WHO <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/points-of-entry-and-mass-gatherings">technical guidance for the management of ill persons at points of entry</a>.</p>
<p>Please read more about the POE program in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PJ4iRJGmUBv6jF7hcACxt-dhd5JRpeBt0mKxgPBsmvc/edit#">system design document</a>.</p>
