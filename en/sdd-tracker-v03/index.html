<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>The COVID-19 Surveillance System Design document provides an overview of the conceptual design used to configure a COVID-19 digital data package in DHIS2. The COVID-19 package was developed in response to an expressed need from countries to rapidly adapt a solution for managing COVID-19 data. This document is intended for use by DHIS2 implementers at country and regional level to be able to support implementation and localisation of the package. The COVID-19 metadata package can be adapted to local needs and national guidelines. In particular, local work flows and national guidelines should be considered in the localization and adoption of the programs included in this package.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p><strong>This design has been updated to reflect new aggregate reporting requirements from the <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331506/WHO-2019-nCoV-SurveillanceGuidance-2020.6-eng.pdf">WHO interim surveillance guidelines updated March 20, 2020</a></strong>. The COVID-19 digital data package was developed in response to an expressed need from countries to rapidly adapt a solution for managing COVID-19 data. UiO has developed COVID-19 surveillance packages for three types of data models (tracker, event-based aggregate) to enable countries to select the model that is most appropriate for their context given the burden of disease and available resources. These models and their relative benefits/limitations are summarized below:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Type of Surveillance Package</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Case-based Surveillance (Tracker)</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Surveillance (Event)</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Surveillance (Aggregate)</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong><em>Description</em></strong>
   </td>
   <td>Enrolls a case and tracks over time through laboratory confirmation & case outcome
   </td>
   <td>Captures critical case details in line-listing format
   </td>
   <td>Enables daily or weekly reporting of key aggregate data points
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong><em>Pros</em></strong>
   </td>
   <td>Highly granular data and multiple time dimensions for analysis, can support decentralized workflow, all events linked to the case
   </td>
   <td>More granular than aggregate and can capture key time dimensions (i.e. report date vs onset of symptoms); reduced burden of data entry compared to tracker and little complexity
   </td>
   <td>Low complexity, easy to implement, most manageable when cases numbers are high
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong><em>Cons</em></strong>
   </td>
   <td>Burden of data entry may be overwhelming when number of cases reach threshold; complexity of implementation
   </td>
   <td>Does not support case-follow up or other decentralized workflows
   </td>
   <td>Less granularity for detailed analysis (i.e. analysis only based on case reporting date, limited disaggregation)
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>This document covers only the design of the surveillance tracker program package</strong>; separate system design documents are available for DHIS2 event and aggregate packages.</p>
<p>WHO is “urging all countries to prepare for the potential arrival of COVID-19 by readying emergency response systems; increasing capacity to detect and care for patients; ensuring hospitals have the space, supplies and necessary personnel; and developing life-saving medical interventions.”</p>
<p>The objectives of COVID-19 surveillance are:</p>
<ol>
<li>to monitor trends of the disease where human to human transmission occurs;</li>
<li>rapidly detect new cases in countries where the virus is not circulating;</li>
<li>provide epidemiological information to conduct risk assessments at the national, regional and global level; and</li>
<li>provide epidemiological information to guide preparedness and response measures.</li>
</ol>
<p>The system design builds upon existing case-based disease surveillance principles and information system requirements that have been developed collaboratively between the WHO and UiO since 2017. The COVID-19 surveillance package was developed with the intent to align to <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/surveillance-and-case-definitions">WHO technical guidance on nCoV-19 surveillance and case definitions</a>, updated March 20, 2020.Note that this design may not necessarily reflect the latest available interim global guidance developed by WHO as updates may be released rapidly. National guidelines and policies may vary and it is recommended to adapt this package to local context.</p>
<h2 id="system-design-summary">System Design Summary</h2>
<p>The DHIS2 case-based surveillance tracker metadata was based on the <strong><a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/2020-02-27-data-dictionary-en.xlsx">WHO COVID-19 case reporting template</a></strong> and the mapping of data dictionaries can be accessed at: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vigXHkP7L2hJ2lrZpdf9u4csQtppMH16">DHIS2 CBS tracker metadata WHO line-list data dictionary</a>.</p>
<p>In the development of this configuration package, an effort has been made to follow UiO’s <a href="https://who.dhis2.org/documentation/general_design_principles.html">general design principles</a> and a common <a href="https://who.dhis2.org/documentation/naming_convention.html">naming convention</a>.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 digital data package supports surveillance workflows and automated analysis for key components of routine and active surveillance. This package includes a Case Surveillance Tracker and a Contact registration &amp; follow-up tracker, which are installed together in the same metadata package. The tracker programs are optimized to be installed with other COVID-19 surveillance packages, including the Points of Entry Screening Tracker and aggregate daily surveillance dataset.</p>

This package can be installed as a standalone COVID-19 package or can be integrated into a country’s existing integrated disease surveillance &amp; response tracker. Metadata for the case-based surveillance tracker is aligned with the WHO <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/data-dictionary-covid-crf-v6.xlsx?sfvrsn=a7d4ef98_2">COVID-19 surveillance data dictionary </a></p>
<pre><code>_n.b. The COVID-19 case-based tracker can be implemented either as a ‘standalone’ program for COVID-19 specific disease surveillance as described here; or, COVID-19 concepts can be integrated into an existing case-based surveillance tracker program if one already exists in-country. Please refer to installation and implementation guidance for more details._

<h2 id="use-case-1-covid-19-case-based-surveillance-tracker">Use Case 1: COVID-19 Case-based surveillance tracker</h2>
<p>The COVID-19 case-based surveillance tracker can be adapted and used by countries to supplement existing national disease surveillance programs. The basic case surveillance program is designed to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enroll suspected* COVID-19 cases (<em>generally appearing at a health facility, but may be enrolled at other places</em>)</li>
<li>Capture key information about the suspected case including demographics and exposures, such as symptoms, contact with a previously confirmed case &amp; travel history</li>
<li>Generate lab requests</li>
<li>Record laboratory diagnosis</li>
<li>Record contacts of a confirmed<strong> or probable</strong>* case for follow-up</li>
<li>Record case outcome</li>
<li>Facilitate case notification and national/regional/global case reporting</li>
<li>Generate dashboards and analytics tools for monitoring disease trends and planning response efforts</li>
</ol>
<p>The design of the case-based tracker program assumes that <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331506/WHO-2019-nCoV-SurveillanceGuidance-2020.6-eng.pdf">WHO case definitions</a> are followed in the use case; its use can be adapted to local case definitions as needed. The WHO case definitions were updated on March 20, 2020 and noted below.</p>
<pre><code>_*Suspected case: A) a patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g., cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other aetiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset; **OR, **B) A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; **OR,** C) A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization AND with no other aetiology that fully explains the clinical presentation._

_**Probable case: A) a suspect case for whom testing for COVID-19 is inconclusive (inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory) **OR,** B) a suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason._

_***Confirmed case: A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms._
</code></pre>
<h2 id="intended-users">Intended users</h2>
<ul>
<li>Health facility users: capture and record details about a suspected case, including clinical symptoms &amp; exposures; track lab results; record case outcome</li>
<li>Laboratory users: receive lab requests and record laboratory results for a particular suspected case</li>
<li>National and local health authorities: monitor and analyse disease surveillance data through dashboards and analytics tools to conduct risk assessments and plan response measures; generate reports for regional and global reporting</li>

<h1 id="use-case-2-covid-19-contact-registration-follow-up">Use Case 2: COVID-19 Contact registration &amp; follow-up</h1>
<p>This program can be used in addition to the case-based surveillance tracker to facilitate the registration and follow-up of contacts of a confirmed case. In this scenario, it is assumed that if any contacts of a confirmed case meet criteria for suspected case and are referred for testing, the case will be enrolled into the COVID-19 Case Surveillance tracker program.</p>
<p>The Contact registration &amp; follow-up program registers each contact of a case (as described in COVID-19 Case Surveillance Use Case) as a new Tracked Entity Instance (person) and links them to the case in the COVID-19 Case Surveillance Program via a ‘relationship.’ It has a simple repeatable follow-up stage where symptoms and any follow-up undertaken can be registered.</p>

<p>Contacts are added to the index case using the relationships menu in the case surveillance program:</p>
<p><img alt="alt_text" src="images/Copy-of6.png" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>Once you select “Add” from the relationships box, you are able to select the relationship and program and either select an existing person or enroll a new contact using the enrollment stage that appears. This will enroll the contact into the contact registration and follow-up program. \
Contacts that are added will then be listed on the case’s tracker dashboard in the relationship widget</p>
<p>You may also enroll them separately into the program. Once enrolled, you will be able to find them for the follow-up as required.</p>
